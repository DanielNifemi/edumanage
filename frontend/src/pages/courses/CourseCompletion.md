# Course Completion Summary

This document provides a summary of the work done to fix the errors in the console, the fixes that have been implemented, and the errors that still need to be resolved.

## Summary of Work Done

The initial error was a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'`. This error was caused by the fact that the required Python packages, including Django, were not installed in the Python environment being used.

The following steps were taken to address this issue:

1.  The `requirements.txt` file was updated to include all the required Python packages.
2.  The Python packages were installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  The Django development server was started using `python manage.py runserver`.

## Implemented Fixes

The following fixes have been implemented:

*   The `requirements.txt` file has been updated to include all the required Python packages.
*   The Python packages have been installed in the virtual environment.
*   The Django development server is now running successfully.

## Remaining Errors

The following errors still need to be resolved:

*   The frontend is not yet connected to the backend.
*   The frontend is not yet displaying any data from the backend.
*   The frontend is not yet able to create, read, update, or delete data from the backend.

## Current State of the Project

The backend is now running successfully, but the frontend is not yet connected to the backend. The next step is to connect the frontend to the backend and display the data from the backend in the frontend.

## Next Steps

The following are the next steps to be taken:

1.  Connect the frontend to the backend.
2.  Display the data from the backend in the frontend.
3.  Implement the ability to create, read, update, and delete data from the backend.
4.  Test the application to ensure that it is working correctly.
5.  Deploy the application to a production environment.
